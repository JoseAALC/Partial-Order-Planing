# Partial-Order-Planing

Project done as part of Bachelor's degree in the course of Introduction to Scientific Research(CC3011) in Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade do porto at departament of Computer Science.

2016/2017

## Objective
- Program an algorithm of partial order planing in C++ 

## Brieve Description
In this project we devlop a partial order planing algorithm with the objective of in future the could be used in webots (https://cyberbotics.com/). For this porpose we implement a representation of first order logic in C++ and a unification algorithm as the way to resolve the value of variables.
